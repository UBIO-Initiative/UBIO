# UBIO
## An open UBI platform powered by cryptocurrency.

### _In Development_

<p>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income" target="_blank">UBI</a>
is a monetary provision given on a regular basis with no strings attached and no
difference in how much everyone to whom it applies gets. Traditionally, it is given
by a government to its citizens, but it can also be given by a private charity to
subscribers of said charity, which is how an open UBI works.

Anyone can subscribe to UBIO, and subscription is 100% free. All one needs to do is
provide a BitCoin wallet address to which BitCoin may be sent, in addition to their
phone number and email address in order to verify their identity.

To express our motives and goals in more detail, we, the UBIO Initiative, have compiled [this presentation](https://kaeon.gitlab.io/kaeon-united/?unitedjs=https://nearpaste.vercel.app/Y0qBrgj/raw).
